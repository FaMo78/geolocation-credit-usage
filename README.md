🌍 Postal Data Usage in Global Credit Reporting
This repository explores how credit reporting agencies around the world utilize postal data (addresses and postal codes).

📝 Overview
🔑 Primary Use: Postal data is mainly used for identity verification and record matching.

🌐 Global Standard: Most countries do not use postal codes directly in credit scoring models to ensure fairness and avoid location-based discrimination.

🇦🇺 Exception: Australia’s Equifax “Next Generation Score” uniquely incorporates postal code data as a predictive factor, particularly for individuals with thin credit files.
